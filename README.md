TSAWS: bringing the TSA to Amazon Web Services:
    'Can I ask you to step aside for a random inspection? '

Inspired by Security Squirrel: https://github.com/Securosis/SecuritySquirrel
and the TSA, TSAWS aims to be a non-intrusive way to perform detective
forensics on a running AWS instance that you may suspect has been compromised.

Using the official amazon boto library and open source forensic tools, TSAWS
allows you to investigate an amazon account, inventory instances, volumes,
snapshots, etc and automate the process of performing memory/disk forensics
to look for signs of compromise.
